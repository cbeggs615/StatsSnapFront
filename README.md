# StatsSnapFront

## User Journey

Snoopy is a sports fan who follows the Red Sox and Rockies in the MLB, the Ravens in the NFL, and the Celtics in the NBA. He’s tired of jumping between ESPN, NFL.com, and MLB.com just to see how his teams are doing, and frustrated by all the ads and clutter.

Then, Snoopy discovers StatSnap. After signing up, he adds his favorite teams, and they instantly appear on his MyTeams Dashboard — clean, organized, and ad-free.

He clicks Manage for the Red Sox to customize what stats he tracks, adding batting average for MLB teams. When he adds the Celtics, he swaps out losses for points per game, and the dashboard updates right away.

Finally, Snoopy adds the Ravens — but after seeing their record, he decides to remove them. Satisfied with his personalized dashboard, he logs out knowing his settings will be saved for the next time he comes back to StatSnap.
