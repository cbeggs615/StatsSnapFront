# StatsSnapFront

## User Journey

Snoopy is a sports fan who follows the Ravens in the NFL and the Phillies in the MLB. With games across different leagues and times, he used to bounce between apps like ESPN, NFL.com, and MLB.com just to figure out how they’re doing. He’s frustrated that each app buries him in ads and articles when all he really wants are scores and key stats.

Then, Snoopy discovers StatsSnap. He creates an account and logs in for the first time. On setup, he’s prompted to add his favorite teams — he starts with the Ravens and the Phillies. Instantly, they appear on his "My Tracked Teams" Dashboard, where each team tile shows a snapshot of their key stats in one clean, ad-free view. When clicked, the teams show all their key stats.

Wanting to personalize his dashboard, Snoopy taps Edit Stats and chooses which metrics matter most to him. He decides to add home runs for MLB teams. Now, when he clicks on the Phillies, he can see that stat added to the list of stats for the team. He decides to add the Orioles, but after being disappointed by their wins-losses count, he decides to stop tracking them.

Then, Snoopy logs out.
